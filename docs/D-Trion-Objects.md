# D. Trion Objects

## D.1. Overview
Trion Objects are the fundamental data structures that define all entities, states, and transitions inside the TrionChain ecosystem.  
They provide a standardized, predictable, and mathematically consistent format for representing:

- Assets  
- Transactions  
- Smart contract outputs  
- RWA entities  
- State transitions  
- Validator commitments  
- Boundary events  

The Trion Object Model gives TrionChain the structure and determinism required for an FEM-inspired, region-based blockchain.

---

## D.2. Motivation for Trion Objects

Traditional blockchains rely on heterogeneous data structures across different modules and layers.  
This creates complexity and makes cross-chain or cross-module behavior unpredictable.

TrionChain solves this by introducing **a unified, consistent object model**, ensuring:

- Deterministic processing  
- Seamless movement of objects across cells  
- Predictable execution logic  
- Compatibility with RWA pipelines  
- Standardization for developers and institutions  

---

## D.3. Categories of Trion Objects

TrionChain defines five main categories:

1. **State Objects**  
2. **Transaction Objects**  
3. **Event Objects**  
4. **RWA Objects**  
5. **System Objects**  

Below is the detailed structure of each.

---

## D.4. State Objects

State Objects represent the **persistent state** stored inside a Trion-Cell.

### Examples of State Objects:
- Account state  
- Contract storage  
- Token balances  
- Cell-local variables  
- Boundary state variables  

### Structure Example:
```json
{
  "type": "state",
  "object_id": "state:account:0x123",
  "cell_id": "cell-4",
  "data": {
    "balance": 2000,
    "nonce": 58
  },
  "version": 10492
}
```

---

## D.5. Transaction Objects

Transaction Objects represent actions initiated by users, validators, or smart contracts.

### Examples:
- Transfers  
- Contract calls  
- Cross-cell requests  
- RWA updates  
- Validator staking operations  

### Structure Example:
```json
{
  "type": "transaction",
  "tx_id": "0xabc123",
  "sender": "0x1229...",
  "cell_origin": "cell-3",
  "payload": {
    "action": "transfer",
    "to": "0x9887",
    "amount": 50
  },
  "timestamp": 1749201002
}
```

---

## D.6. Event Objects

Event Objects represent outputs generated during execution.

### Examples:
- Cell-local logs  
- Boundary crossing requests  
- State change notifications  
- RWA triggers  
- Oracle events  

### Structure Example:
```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event_id": "ev:bound:0x44",
  "cell_source": "cell-2",
  "data": {
    "variable": "energy_flow",
    "value": 57.8
  }
}
```

---

## D.7. RWA Objects

RWA Objects model tokenized real-world entities.  
These objects follow strict standards to maintain institutional compatibility.

### RWA Object types include:
- Infrastructure (energy grid nodes, pipelines, substations)  
- Agriculture (fields, lots, crop batches)  
- Minerals & mining blocks  
- Industrial assets  
- Property units  
- Financial instruments (notes, bonds, carbon credits)  

### Structure Example:
```json
{
  "type": "rwa",
  "object_id": "rwa:land:bolivia:lot-55A",
  "cell_id": "cell-7",
  "metadata": {
    "location": "UYUNI-SUR",
    "area": "3.1 hectares",
    "owner": "GAHER S.A.",
    "valuation_usd": 148000
  },
  "compliance": {
    "issuer_authorized": true,
    "external_registry_id": "reg-028881"
  }
}
```

---

## D.8. System Objects

System Objects represent internal infrastructure components of the TrionChain protocol.

### Examples:
- Validator commitments  
- Boundary proofs  
- Cell execution reports  
- Global assembly results  
- Consensus checkpoints  

### Structure Example:
```json
{
  "type": "system",
  "object_id": "sys:checkpoint:1032",
  "data": {
    "cell_commitments": ["cell1:hash...", "cell2:hash..."],
    "timestamp": 1749201440
  }
}
```

---

## D.9. Object Lifecycle

Every Trion Object follows a structured lifecycle:

1. **Creation**  
   Object is generated by a transaction, oracle, validator, or system module.

2. **Cell Processing**  
   Processed by Compute Nodes inside a Trion-Cell.

3. **Boundary Evaluation** (if applicable)  
   Boundary Nodes evaluate whether the object crosses into neighboring cells.

4. **Global Assembly**  
   Consensus Nodes integrate the object into the global state.

5. **Persistence**  
   Storage Nodes record finalized objects and states.

This mirrors the FEM lifecycle:  
*Local → Boundary → Global → Persistent.*

## D.10. Benefits of the Trion Object Model

- **Deterministic behavior across all layers**  
- **Guaranteed compatibility between cells**  
- **Smooth cross-cell transitions**  
- **Formal structure supporting RWA ecosystems**  
- **Simplifies developer experience**  
- **Institution-ready abstraction layer**

They ensure deterministic execution, predictable cross-cell interactions, strong compatibility with RWA, and a foundation for the FEM-inspired architecture.
